2
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:44,829
Come here quick.

3
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:47,505
Come here.

4
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:52,445
Huang Tai Tai, this is my daughter.

5
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,104
Come here, Lindo.

6
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,340
Come over here.

7
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,007
Come to Mama.

8
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,483
Don't keep Huang Tai Tai
waiting.

9
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:04,447
She looks like a brat.

10
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:07,789
She's usually very obedient.

11
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,294
She's just shy today.

12
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:20,672
She looks so skinny.

13
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,800
Don't go by her looks.

14
00:19:24,377 --> 00:19:27,904
Look at that lucky face.

15
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:31,109
She'll give you many grandsons.

16
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,748
Come here! Come here!

17
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:42,761
Have Huang Tai Tai take
a closer look at you.

18
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,638
Stop stuffing yourself!

19
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,934
No girl should eat so fast.

20
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,195
Look at those dirty spots!

21
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,634
Who would want such a dirty
daughter-in-law?

22
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:27,639
Always be careful.

23
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:30,801
Otherwise when you go
to Huang Tai Tai's,

24
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,811
she will disapprove of you.

25
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,823
Remember...

26
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:00,695
when you see Huang Tai Tai,

27
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:04,031
act happy.

28
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:09,037
Really, you are very lucky.

29
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:19,540
The marriage ceremony has begun.

30
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,643
Bride and groom, pay respect
to each other.

31
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,942
Pay respect to the ancestors.

32
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:33,319
Be blessed with prosperity!

33
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:38,720
Be blessed with many sons!

34
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,841
I have prayed to the gods
many days for you,

35
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,401
so that you were not too ugly,

36
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,071
or too old.

37
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,513
I must have prayed too hard.

38
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:48,923
Ha! Scared you to death!

39
00:25:58,538 --> 00:25:59,937
I am the husband.

40
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:02,474
I make all the decisions.

41
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:05,541
You sleep on the floor.

42
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,609
Do it! Do it now!

43
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:00,023
Where are my grandsons?

44
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:03,959
My son says...

45
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:06,972
you often refuse...

46
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,769
to sleep with him.

47
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:12,333
What kind of a wife are you?

48
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,027
You sleep on your side.

49
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:07,490
Where are my grandsons?

50
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,398
Huh?

51
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:12,836
My son says he's planted enough
seeds in you to fill a basket.

52
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:16,102
Plenty for ten thousand grandsons!

53
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,665
It's all your fault!

54
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,005
Always running around,

55
00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:22,275
letting my son's seeds spill out.

56
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:23,440
From now on,

57
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:25,416
you lie in bed all day.

58
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:26,747
Lie down!

59
00:28:27,353 --> 00:28:28,911
Lie down!

60
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:31,013
Until my grandson comes!

61
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,455
Do you hear me?

62
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:34,959
Disgusting little thing!

63
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,790
Close all the windows!

64
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:14,429
Feel this. I'm pregnant.

65
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,559
That's impossible.

66
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:18,399
It's yours!

67
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:04,482
What'd I tell you?

68
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,745
She's like this all the time.

69
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,533
What the hell's happening?

70
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,127
What's wrong?

71
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,697
Tell me quick!

72
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,335
It's so scary.

73
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:31,899
It's too terrible to say.

74
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:33,969
I had a bad dream.

75
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,848
Our ancestors came to me!

76
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,577
So angry!

77
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,381
They told me if Tyan-yu stays...

78
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:44,014
in this marriage,

79
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,785
he will die.

80
00:30:45,858 --> 00:30:48,019
What's this bullshit?

81
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:50,494
What a stupid girl to have bad dreams!

82
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:53,223
The ancestors said...

83
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:55,529
if the matter is not settled immediately,

84
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,125
they will begin...

85
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,797
the cycle of destruction!

86
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:02,272
There are three signs, he said.

87
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:05,310
First, he has drawn a spot
on Tyan-yu's back.

88
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:08,472
And this spot will eat away
Tyan-yu's flesh.

89
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:12,313
Just as it ate away our ancestor's face.

90
00:31:21,994 --> 00:31:25,725
Next, our ancestor touched my mouth.

91
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:27,663
Our ancestor said...

92
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:31,829
if I don't leave this marriage,
all my teeth will fall out.

93
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:35,169
But how could I leave this family
I love so much?

94
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:38,472
I live and die for this family.

95
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,617
Our ancestor also said
this girl here...

96
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:55,684
is Tyan-yu's true spiritual wife...

97
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:59,094
already growing his son!

98
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:01,030
It's true!

99
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,265
To prove it our ancestor planted
the seed in her womb.

100
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:08,864
Already ripe in one day.

101
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:10,909
Ah Ping! Come over here!

102
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:13,410
Come over here!

103
00:32:25,124 --> 00:32:27,285
If you don't believe me,

104
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,055
ask the matchmaker.

105
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:50,471
Matchmaker, how could you?

106
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:52,676
How could you?

107
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:54,413
Well...

108
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:56,512
mistakes happen in Heaven.

109
00:32:56,589 --> 00:32:58,250
The hell with this!

110
00:32:58,324 --> 00:32:59,723
Get out!

111
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:02,090
All of you!

112
00:48:01,726 --> 00:48:04,456
You're so lucky.

113
00:48:04,529 --> 00:48:06,997
You don't have ears like mine.

114
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:11,327
You'll have a better life!

115
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:14,998
But listen carefully to what is calling.

116
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:19,033
Can you feel in your heart...

117
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:22,375
what I am saying?

118
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:26,816
Will you always keep it there?

119
00:48:32,123 --> 00:48:34,091
You know...

120
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:37,219
after today...

121
00:48:37,295 --> 00:48:40,662
I will never...

122
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:47,332
give you any more advice.

123
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:51,740
Stop looking!

124
00:53:19,177 --> 00:53:20,769
Open the watermelon!

125
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:41,298
Dog fart!

126
00:56:55,071 --> 00:56:57,596
<i>Honored guests!</i>

127
00:56:57,674 --> 00:56:59,403
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

128
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:02,445
<i>I have persuaded the famous diva,
Miss Bai Yen,</i>

129
00:57:02,512 --> 00:57:06,346
to sing in honor of my son.

130
00:57:47,257 --> 00:57:49,725
Let me have him.

131
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:02,600
Don't touch it!

132
00:58:22,993 --> 00:58:24,551
Who's this?

133
00:58:25,328 --> 00:58:27,922
This person is a whore.

134
00:58:27,998 --> 00:58:30,228
Just like you.

135
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:41,143
My son!

136
00:58:41,845 --> 00:58:43,870
My son!

137
00:58:43,947 --> 00:58:45,938
Listen to that voice!

138
00:58:46,016 --> 00:58:47,483
Strong...

139
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:50,815
like his father!

140
00:58:57,127 --> 00:58:59,857
Look at you! Disgusting!

141
00:59:00,664 --> 00:59:02,632
You make me sick!

142
00:59:21,451 --> 00:59:23,146
Clean up this mess!

143
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,950
You hear me?

144
01:17:56,198 --> 01:17:58,063
You are not my daughter.

145
01:18:02,271 --> 01:18:03,829
If you have any self-respect,

146
01:18:03,906 --> 01:18:05,840
you should kill yourself.

147
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:11,075
Your husband just died,

148
01:18:11,146 --> 01:18:13,580
and you've become another man's concubine.

149
01:19:22,151 --> 01:19:25,348
If you have any dignity,
leave right away.

150
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:28,116
Let your mother go to heaven in peace.

151
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,920
You are no longer her daughter.

152
01:21:45,494 --> 01:21:48,156
Mama, don't leave.

153
01:21:53,135 --> 01:21:56,627
Mama, don't leave.

154
01:22:05,914 --> 01:22:08,712
An-Mei, Mama's leaving.

155
01:22:10,919 --> 01:22:15,185
Respect your uncle
and your aunties.

156
01:22:15,257 --> 01:22:18,590
Remember, be obedient!

157
01:22:24,599 --> 01:22:27,659
Don't forget your Mama.

158
01:22:31,173 --> 01:22:32,572
If you take this child away,

159
01:22:32,607 --> 01:22:34,165
she will become like you.

160
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:35,971
Never able to face anyone.

161
01:22:36,044 --> 01:22:39,480
Never able to lift her head.

162
01:22:56,598 --> 01:23:00,034
You are going to ruin her whole life!

163
01:36:19,901 --> 01:36:22,131
So you've come back already.

164
01:36:24,839 --> 01:36:27,399
This is the daughter you wanted
permission to bring?

165
01:36:28,543 --> 01:36:31,478
Yes. Her name is An-Mei.

166
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:39,378
Put this on.

167
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:49,995
Second Wife, this is too expensive
for a small child.

168
01:36:50,064 --> 01:36:52,259
She is not worthy of it.

169
01:36:55,269 --> 01:36:58,397
Who is she to say who is worthy?

170
01:36:59,273 --> 01:37:02,003
A treasure like you,

171
01:37:02,076 --> 01:37:05,341
needs precious pearls to
light up your face.

172
01:37:05,413 --> 01:37:08,849
You may call me Big Mother.

173
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,018
Give them back. Hurry now.

174
01:37:15,089 --> 01:37:19,048
If you don't thank Big Mother,

175
01:37:20,127 --> 01:37:22,595
you will make me very angry.

176
01:37:28,369 --> 01:37:29,768
Thank you Big Mother.

177
01:37:41,883 --> 01:37:44,545
An-Mei, give me the necklace!

178
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:51,424
I know you don't want to.

179
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:56,096
But I will not have her buy you
for such a cheap price.

180
01:38:03,604 --> 01:38:06,038
Why should you believe me?

181
01:38:06,107 --> 01:38:08,473
I have become nothing.

182
01:38:09,343 --> 01:38:12,107
A Fourth Wife!

183
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:14,113
A low-class concubine.

184
01:38:22,023 --> 01:38:23,854
But An-Mei,

185
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:28,192
I was not always like this.

186
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:31,928
I was a First Wife.

187
01:38:31,999 --> 01:38:33,626
Your father's only wife!

188
01:38:35,536 --> 01:38:37,197
Never forget that!

189
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:41,806
You are a daughter of a First Wife.

190
01:38:54,522 --> 01:38:56,353
You can't!

191
01:38:56,424 --> 01:38:58,790
My daughter is with me.

192
01:38:58,859 --> 01:39:01,089
Then send her away.

193
01:39:01,162 --> 01:39:02,686
Or let her watch!

194
01:39:10,071 --> 01:39:15,236
An-Mei, go to your nanny's room.

195
01:39:17,578 --> 01:39:18,875
Please.

196
01:39:34,628 --> 01:39:38,564
An-Mei, why are you here alone?

197
01:39:38,632 --> 01:39:40,691
I've been looking for you everywhere.

198
01:39:44,138 --> 01:39:46,902
Is that his smell?

199
01:39:50,478 --> 01:39:53,470
Why did you bring me here?

200
01:39:57,952 --> 01:39:59,886
Nanny told me.

201
01:40:00,454 --> 01:40:02,479
She told me everything.

202
01:40:02,556 --> 01:40:05,423
You went to West Lake Temple,

203
01:40:05,493 --> 01:40:07,518
to make offerings in memory
of my father.

204
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:13,430
Wu Tsing saw you there.

205
01:40:14,235 --> 01:40:15,964
Second Wife invited you over...

206
01:40:17,004 --> 01:40:20,167
<i>to play mah-jong.</i>

207
01:40:21,275 --> 01:40:22,469
<i>That night,</i>

208
01:40:23,677 --> 01:40:25,838
<i>Wu Tsing came to your room</i>...

209
01:41:43,924 --> 01:41:45,789
Give me back my son!

210
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:48,021
Give me back my son!

211
01:42:08,716 --> 01:42:10,946
I stayed alive,

212
01:42:11,018 --> 01:42:14,852
to keep my hope of seeing you again
one day.

213
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:21,288
So it's all true!

214
01:42:28,969 --> 01:42:33,929
I brought you here to give you
a better life.

215
01:42:35,142 --> 01:42:37,133
But now...

216
01:42:38,112 --> 01:42:41,047
I know what I really have to do.

217
01:42:48,489 --> 01:42:51,583
Mama! Wake up!

218
01:42:52,226 --> 01:42:55,059
Hurry, wake up!

219
01:43:46,547 --> 01:43:47,980
Mama?

220
01:43:48,048 --> 01:43:50,380
Can you see?

221
01:43:50,451 --> 01:43:52,942
Can you see I am no longer scared?

222
01:43:54,788 --> 01:43:57,814
I am strong now.

223
01:43:57,891 --> 01:43:59,825
I see clearly now...

224
01:43:59,893 --> 01:44:03,522
what's true and what's false.

225
01:44:25,085 --> 01:44:26,518
My mother's ghost will return...

226
01:44:26,587 --> 01:44:28,782
in three days to settle scores.

227
01:44:28,856 --> 01:44:31,518
That day will be the Lunar New Year.

228
01:44:31,592 --> 01:44:33,526
All debts must be paid by then.

229
01:44:33,594 --> 01:44:36,529
Or horrible tragedies will befall you.

230
01:44:43,604 --> 01:44:48,268
Lord Buddha, forgive me.

231
02:13:10,439 --> 02:13:14,307
Mama's gone to heaven.

232
02:13:17,112 --> 02:13:20,138
Gone? Mama's dead?

233
02:13:21,817 --> 02:13:23,785
When?

234
02:13:23,852 --> 02:13:26,320
Four months ago.

235
02:13:34,797 --> 02:13:38,096
She loved you very much.

236
02:13:38,167 --> 02:13:41,466
I'm your sister.June.

237
02:13:41,537 --> 02:13:44,165
Our little sister.

238
02:13:46,308 --> 02:13:51,746
I've come to take our mother's place.

239
02:13:51,814 --> 02:13:55,375
I've come to bring you her hopes...

240
02:13:57,386 --> 02:13:58,876
Our sister.

241
02:14:06,328 --> 02:14:08,319
Our family.
